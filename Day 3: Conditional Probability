In this challenge, we get started with conditional probability. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials! 


Task 
Suppose a family has  children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

1 / 3
1 / 2
2 / 3
1 / 9

Ans : 1/3
explanation: The conditional probablity of A when B has occured already is denoted as P(A|B) = P(Aâˆ©B)/P(B)
Conditional Probability: P(A|B) = P(A AND B)/P(A)

P(Both are Boys | One is a Boy) = P(Both are Boys AND One is a Boy)/P(One is a Boy)

P(One is a Boy)= 1 

P(Both are Boys AND One is a Boy) = 1/3 (if one is a boy then BB, BG, or GB)

P(Both are Boys | One is a Boy) = (1/3)/1 = 1/3
