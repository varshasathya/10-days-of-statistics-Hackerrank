Task 
You draw 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacing them. What is the probability that both cards are of the same suit?

1 / 156
1 / 39
12 / 39
12 / 51

ans: 12/51

explanation: Initially you have 52 cards, 13*4 (4 suites). There are 13 ways to select a color card out of 52.
again if you pick one more card, there are 12 remaining of the same color, out of total 51 remainig cards.
No. of ways to select 2 cards = (1) * (2) = (13/52) * (12/51) = 3/51.
This is for 1 color, as there are 4 colors, total = (4 * 3)/51 = 12/51.
