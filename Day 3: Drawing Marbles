Task 
A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

1 / 12
7 / 12
1 / 6
2 / 3

A: 2/3
explanation: After 1 red marble is drawn, there will be 2 red marbles and 4 blue marbles in the bag.So, in the bag's current state, 
there is a 2/6 probability of drawing a red marble and  a 4/6 probability of drawing a blue marble.Because our goal is to find the 
probability of drawing a blue marble, our answer is 4/6 (which reduces to 2/3 ).
