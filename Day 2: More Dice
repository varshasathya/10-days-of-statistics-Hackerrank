Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability.

Task 
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be 
different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

1 / 9                                       1 / 6
2 / 3                                       5 / 6

ans: 1/9

Explanation:

We define E to be the event satisfying the following conditions: 

1.The values rolled by both dice are different.
2.The sum of the values rolled is 6.

The set of outcomes satisfying E is:{(1,5),(2,4),(4,2),(5,1)}.We also know that the size of the sample space is 36.

thus 4/39 = =1/9
