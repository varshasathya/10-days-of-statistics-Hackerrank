Objective 
In this challenge, we practice calculating probability. 

Task 
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that their sum will be at most 9.
<p>2 / 3</p>                   <p>5 / 6</p>
<p>1 / 4</p>                   <p>1 / 6</p>

Ans:  <p>5 / 6</p>

explanation: 
When two dice are rolled, we have 6 possibilities for each roll. Thus there are 36 total combinations.
Let's list the combinations that result in sums greater than 9.
(4,6) (6,4) (5,5) (6,5) (5,6) (6,6) which gives 6 out of 36 possiblities.
But what we require is the probability that their sum will be "at most" 9
Thus,the remaining 30/36 possibilities gives the less than or equal to 9 probability.
i.e; 30/36 = 5/6
